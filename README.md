# Nix Bootstrap for Termux (aarch64-linux)

Bootstrap Nix package manager for Termux on Android with a custom prefix at `/data/data/com.termux/files/nix`.

This project enables running Nix on Android devices through Termux without requiring root access or modifying `/nix`. It's specifically designed for **aarch64 (ARM64) devices only**.

## Background

This project combines two powerful Nix techniques:

1. **Custom Store Prefix**: Based on dramforever's ["Bootstrapping Nix"](https://dram.page/p/bootstrapping-nix/), we build Nix to work with `/data/data/com.termux/files/nix` instead of `/nix`

2. **Cross Compilation**: Following the [official Nix cross-compilation guide](https://nix.dev/tutorials/cross-compilation.html), we build for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` from any platform

**Important optimization**: We use the `NIX_STORE_DIR` environment variable override approach, which means we can skip one stage of the bootstrap! As dramforever noted: "the NIX_STORE variable can override the pre-configured settings within Nix. In other words, Nix does not require rebuilding for a 'cross-compiling' scenario like this. We can save one stage of Nix."

### Why Custom Prefix?

The standard Nix installation uses `/nix/store`, which requires root access to create. By using a custom prefix at `/data/data/com.termux/files/nix`, we can:
- Install Nix without root access
- Run entirely within Termux's accessible filesystem
- Maintain full Nix functionality including store management and garbage collection

### The Bootstrap Process

This bootstrap uses a simplified two-stage approach (saving one stage thanks to NIX_STORE override):

1. **Cross-compile**: Use an existing Nix installation (on any platform, e.g., x86_64) to cross-compile Nix and dependencies for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` using the `crossSystem` parameter
2. **Package**: Bundle the cross-compiled Nix with all stdenv bootstrap stages and essential tools into a tarball
3. **Deploy**: Extract and install on Termux device, using environment variables (NIX_STORE_DIR, etc.) to point to the custom store location

**Key optimizations**:
- **Cross-compilation**: Following [nix.dev's guide](https://nix.dev/tutorials/cross-compilation.html), we can build for ARM64 from any platform
- **NIX_STORE override**: The original three-stage approach is not needed because Nix respects the `NIX_STORE_DIR` environment variable, allowing a single build to work with any store location

### How We Follow the nix.dev Cross-Compilation Guide

The nix.dev guide teaches us about **platforms** in cross-compilation:

- **Build platform**: Where we compile (e.g., x86_64-linux)
- **Host platform**: Where the compiled binary runs (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu for Termux)
- **Target platform**: For compilers only (we assume host = target)

We follow the guide's recommended approach exactly:

```nix
# In bootstrap.nix - as shown in the guide
{ crossSystem ? null
, pkgs ? 
    if crossSystem != null
    then import <nixpkgs> { inherit crossSystem; }
    else import <nixpkgs> {}
}:
```

Then we build using:

```bash
nix-build bootstrap.nix -A installer \
  --arg crossSystem '{ config = "aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu"; }'
```

The platform config string `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` follows the standard format `<cpu>-<vendor>-<os>-<abi>` where:
- `aarch64` = ARM 64-bit CPU
- `unknown` = vendor (often unknown or pc)
- `linux` = operating system
- `gnu` = GNU ABI (glibc-based)

This is identical to what you'd get by running `config.guess` on an aarch64 Android/Linux system, and matches the `pkgsCross.aarch64-multiplatform` pre-defined platform in nixpkgs.

**Historical note**: Cross-compilation support in Nixpkgs has evolved significantly. Matthew Bauer's 2018 guide introduced many developers to the `pkgsCross` attribute and established patterns for build vs. runtime dependencies. Since then (particularly since 18.09), the framework has matured with more elegant handling and better integration. Our implementation uses the current best practices from the official documentation.

### Understanding Build, Host, and Target Platforms

Following the [Nixpkgs cross-compilation infrastructure](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-cross), we distinguish between three platform types:

- **Build platform** (`buildPlatform`): Where the compilation happens (e.g., your x86_64-linux laptop)
- **Host platform** (`hostPlatform`): Where the compiled program will run (aarch64-linux for Termux)
- **Target platform** (`targetPlatform`): Only relevant for compilers themselves; we assume host = target

In our case:
- **Build**: x86_64-linux (or whatever you're building on)
- **Host**: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu (Termux on Android ARM64)
- **Target**: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu (same as host, since we're not building a cross-compiler)

The Nixpkgs manual explains that dependencies are categorized by which platforms they involve:

- **`nativeBuildInputs`** (build-time dependencies): Tools that run during build on the **build platform** (e.g., compilers, pkg-config, makeWrapper)
- **`buildInputs`** (runtime dependencies): Libraries that the program links against on the **host platform** (e.g., zlib, openssl)

This distinction, as Matthew Bauer explained in his 2018 guide, is crucial: "build-time dependencies should be put in nativeBuildInputs. Runtime dependencies should be put in buildInputs." While this had no effect on native compilation initially, it's now fundamental for correct cross-compilation.

Our bootstrap process correctly handles these distinctions automatically when we set `crossSystem`, ensuring that build tools come from the build platform while target libraries come from the host platform.

> **Note on documentation sources**: We primarily follow the official Nixpkgs manual and nix.dev tutorial, as they represent the current authoritative guidance. Historical resources (like Bauer's 2018 guide) provide valuable context but may use outdated syntax. The NixOS Wiki provides additional community examples but may contain outdated information (it notes itself as "a stub"). When in doubt, we defer to the official documentation.

## Requirements

### For Building (Development Machine)

- A working Nix installation (NixOS, or Nix on Linux/macOS)
- Internet connection
- Adequate disk space (~10-20 GB for build artifacts)
- Time and patience (multi-hour build process)

### For Running (Termux on Android)

- Android device with **aarch64 (ARM64) architecture**
- Termux app installed
- At least 2-3 GB free storage
- Internet connection (for future package builds)

## Building the Bootstrap

On a machine with Nix installed:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nix-termux.git
cd nix-termux

# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build.sh

# Start the build process
./build.sh
```

This will:
- Build a custom Nix configured for Termux paths
- Include all stdenv bootstrap stages (to avoid toolchain rebuilds later)
- Bundle essential utilities (bash, coreutils, git, etc.)
- Create an installer tarball

**Note**: The build can take several hours depending on your hardware, as it compiles:
- Nix itself
- GCC and the complete toolchain
- Glibc and system libraries
- Essential utilities

The output will be: `result/nix-termux-aarch64.tar.gz`

## Installation on Termux

1. **Transfer the tarball to your Android device**:
   ```bash
   # Via USB, cloud storage, or directly with termux
   # Example using curl if hosted somewhere:
   curl -LO https://your-server.com/nix-termux-aarch64.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Extract the tarball**:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf nix-termux-aarch64.tar.gz
   cd tarball
   ```

3. **Run the installer**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

4. **Set up your environment**:
   
   Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   # Source Nix environment
   source ~/path/to/termux-nix-env.sh
   ```

   Or manually add:
   ```bash
   export NIX_PREFIX="/data/data/com.termux/files/nix"
   export NIX_STORE_DIR="$NIX_PREFIX/store"
   export NIX_STATE_DIR="$NIX_PREFIX/var"
   export NIX_CONF_DIR="$NIX_PREFIX/etc"
   export PATH="$NIX_STATE_DIR/nix/profiles/default/bin:$PATH"
   ```

5. **Reload your shell**:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

6. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   nix-env --version
   nix-store --verify --check-contents
   ```

## Usage

### Installing Packages

Since we're using a custom store path, the official binary cache won't work. All packages must be built from source:

```bash
# Install a package (will build from source)
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.hello

# Search for packages
nix-env -qaP | grep python

# Update all packages
nix-env -u '*'
```

### Using with nixpkgs

Clone nixpkgs for local package builds:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git --depth 1
cd nixpkgs

# Install from local nixpkgs
nix-env -f . -iA hello
```

### Garbage Collection

Free up space by removing unused packages:

```bash
# List old generations
nix-env --list-generations

# Delete old generations
nix-env --delete-generations old

# Run garbage collector
nix-collect-garbage

# Aggressive cleanup (remove everything not currently in use)
nix-collect-garbage -d
```

### Configuration

Edit `/data/data/com.termux/files/nix/etc/nix/nix.conf` to customize:
- Build settings (max-jobs, cores)
- Storage optimizations
- Custom binary caches (if you set up your own)

## Important Notes and Design Decisions

### Why Cross-Compilation?

We use cross-compilation from x86_64 to aarch64 because:
1. **Faster builds**: x86_64 development machines are typically more powerful than Android devices
2. **Reproducibility**: Building on a controlled environment ensures consistent results
3. **Convenience**: No need to compile for hours on a mobile device with limited battery

### Why the Custom Prefix?

Android/Termux cannot access `/nix/store` without root. The custom prefix at `/data/data/com.termux/files/nix` allows:
- Installation without root privileges
- Full Nix functionality within Termux's sandbox
- Standard Nix operations (store management, garbage collection, etc.)

### The NIX_STORE_DIR Optimization

As dramforever discovered, Nix respects the `NIX_STORE_DIR` environment variable at runtime. This means:
- **We can skip one bootstrap stage**: Instead of building Nix three times (once for /nix/store, once for our custom store, once to finalize), we build once and use environment variables
- **Single binary works anywhere**: The same Nix binary works with any store location
- **Simpler maintenance**: Fewer moving parts, less complexity

This optimization saves several hours of build time and reduces the complexity of the bootstrap process significantly.

### Dependency Categorization

Following the official Nixpkgs manual and Matthew Bauer's guidance:

- **`nativeBuildInputs`**: Programs executed during build (on build platform)
  - Examples: gcc, pkg-config, makeWrapper, autoconf
  - These must be executable on your x86_64 machine

- **`buildInputs`**: Libraries linked into the final binary (on host platform)
  - Examples: zlib, openssl, ncurses
  - These must be compiled for aarch64 (the target)

Mixing these up causes "Exec format error" (trying to run aarch64 binary on x86_64) or linking errors (linking x86_64 library into aarch64 binary).

### Why We Include All stdenv Bootstrap Stages

The `collectStdenvStages` function recursively collects all stages of the standard environment bootstrap. This ensures:
- **No toolchain rebuilds**: Users won't need to rebuild GCC, glibc, binutils, etc.
- **Faster first installs**: Common build tools are pre-installed
- **Better offline support**: More self-contained installation

The tradeoff is a larger tarball (~1-2 GB), but this is worth it for the time saved.

### Platform Triple Format

We use `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` following the LLVM target triple format:
- `aarch64`: 64-bit ARM CPU architecture
- `unknown`: Vendor field (often "unknown" or "pc" - not critical)
- `linux`: Operating system kernel
- `gnu`: ABI/C library (glibc-based GNU toolchain)

This is more precise than Nix's simpler `aarch64-linux` system string and is recognized by all modern toolchains (GCC, Clang, Rust, etc.).

### Why Not Use Binary Cache?

The official Nix binary cache (cache.nixos.org) serves packages for `/nix/store`. Our packages are in `/data/data/com.termux/files/nix/store`. The paths are **embedded in the binaries** as part of Nix's functional dependency tracking, so we cannot use pre-built binaries.

Options for faster builds:
1. Set up your own binary cache for the custom prefix
2. Use the "lazy cross-compiling" technique from the NixOS Wiki (fetch some dependencies from official aarch64 cache)
3. Build on a powerful server and transfer the store paths

### Documentation Evolution

Cross-compilation in Nixpkgs has evolved significantly:
- **2018 (18.09)**: Basic `pkgsCross` support established (Matthew Bauer's era)
- **2023-2024**: Refined with better splicing, cleaner API, more robust handling
- **Current**: Official tutorial (nix.dev) and comprehensive manual (Nixpkgs) are authoritative

When reading older resources (including some of our referenced guides), be aware that:
- Syntax may have changed (e.g., `system` vs `crossSystem` parameter handling)
- Some workarounds are no longer needed
- Best practices have evolved

We follow current official documentation and note when historical resources differ.

## Limitations

1. **No Binary Cache**: The official Nix binary cache serves packages for `/nix/store`. With our custom prefix, we must build everything from source.

2. **Build Time**: First-time installation of packages will be slow as they compile from source.

3. **Architecture**: Only aarch64-linux is supported. No x86_64 or armv7l.

4. **Storage**: Nix store can grow large. Monitor storage and use garbage collection regularly.

5. **Link Rot**: Some packages may fail to build if source URLs are dead. Use `tarballs.nixos.org` mirror when possible.

6. **Android Limitations**: Some packages may not work due to Android's non-standard environment (different filesystem layout, no systemd, limited /proc, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### "nix-env: command not found"

Ensure you've sourced the environment setup:
```bash
source ~/termux-nix-env.sh
```

### Database Errors

Re-initialize the database:
```bash
nix-store --init
nix-store --load-db < /data/data/com.termux/files/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite
```

### Build Failures

Check logs:
```bash
# View build logs
nix-store --read-log /nix/store/...-package-name
```

### Out of Space

Run garbage collection:
```bash
nix-collect-garbage -d
```

## Advanced: Creating Your Own Binary Cache

To speed up future installations, you can set up a binary cache:

1. Build packages on a build server
2. Sign and push to an S3 bucket or HTTP server
3. Configure `substituters` in `nix.conf`

See: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/package-management/binary-cache-substituter.html
